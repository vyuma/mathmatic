## Key Testing Patterns Used

1. **Mocking External Dependencies**
   - MathLive library mocked for component tests
   - LocalStorage mocked for service tests
   - DOM APIs mocked for file operations

2. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Comprehensive error scenarios for all major functions
   - Graceful degradation testing
   - Error boundary testing

3. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Empty inputs and null values
   - Invalid data formats
   - Storage quota exceeded scenarios
   - Network-like failures

4. **Integration-Style Tests**
   - Hook tests that verify complete workflows
   - Service tests that test multiple operations together
   - Component tests that verify user interactions

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: Tests cover all major code paths and edge cases
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in any order
- **Clarity**: Test names clearly describe what is being tested
- **Maintainability**: Tests use helper functions and clear setup/teardown
- **Performance**: Tests run quickly with appropriate mocking

## Notes

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the math-markdown-notepad application's core functionality. All tests follow best practices for React/TypeScript testing and include proper error handling, edge case coverage, and integration scenarios.

The tests are designed to be maintainable and provide confidence in the application's reliability, especially around critical features like data persistence, math rendering, and user interactions.
